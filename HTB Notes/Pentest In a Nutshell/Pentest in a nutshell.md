### FTP
FTP is a basic method for moving files between computers over a networkâ€”think of it as a digital courier service. It allows you to upload files to a remote computer (like sending packages) or download files from it (like receiving packages).
```
ftp [IP] 21
```
anonymous:anonymous

#### Information Gathering in FTP
ls -la
get (file name)
ls -al

important for clues
get .bash-history
get .ssh

ssh directory
**id_rsa** is the private key that should be kept secret and never shared
**id_rsa.pub** is the public key that can be shared with other systems

#### Information Gathering in Wordpress
We'll enumerate plugins (-e p), skip TLS checks (--disable-tls-checks), set the plugin detection mode to passive (--plugins-detection passive), and use 100 threads (-t 100) to speed up the enumeration.
```
wpscan -e p --url https://10.129.12.10 --disable-tls-checks --no-banner --plugins-detection passive -t 100
```
